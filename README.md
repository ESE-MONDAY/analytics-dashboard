# Analytics Dashboard Hackathon Project

## Overview

This project is a submission for the [GeePay Design and Frontend Challenge](https://www.geegpay.africa/blog/geegpay-design-and-front-end-challenge-unleash-your-creativity) organized by [Geepay Africa](https://www.geegpay.africa/blog/geegpay-design-and-front-end-challenge-unleash-your-creativity). The goal was to build an analytics dashboard based on the provided Figma design, utilizing Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, React-Chartjs-2, and DaisyUI.

- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework used for styling the components, providing a modern and responsive design.

- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances development with static types.

- **React-Chartjs-2**: A React wrapper for Chart.js, used for creating interactive and visually appealing charts in the analytics dashboard.

- **DaisyUI**: A UI component library for Tailwind CSS, used to enhance the design and user interface of the dashboard.
